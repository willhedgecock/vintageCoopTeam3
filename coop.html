    <h2>What is a Co-op?</h2>
    <img src="img/groupPhoto.png" alt="logo" class="float left"  style="width:300px;">
      <p>A housing cooperative or a housing co-op, is a legal entity, usually a cooperative or a corporation, which owns real estate, consisting of one or more residential buildings.
        It is one type of housing tenure. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that has many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as 
        single family home ownership, condominiums and renting.</p>
      <p>The corporation is membership-based, with membership granted by way of a share purchase in the cooperative. Each shareholder in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. </p>
      <p>There are two categories of Co-operative housing:
            <ul>
                <li>Equity co-operatives</li>
                <li>Non-equity co-operatives</li>
            </ul>
        <p>In equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws <br>
          as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperative's rules, while in non-equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement, which is similar to a lease.</p>

      <h2>Why A Co-op?</h2>
      <img src="img/active.png" alt="logo" class="float left"  style="width:300px;">
        <p>A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members' resources so that their buying power is leveraged, thus lowering the cost per member in all<br>
            the services and products associated with home ownership.</p>
        <p>As an advantage also, co-ops offer a less expensive housing option. They are usually cheaper, per square foot than condos in the same area, with the added benefit of lower closing costs. A future sale of a unit can result in significant financial gains, even though owners aren’t building equity.</p>
        <p>Also, a co-op is a multi-unit property owned by a company, usually a Limited-Liability Company (LLC), and people who purchase a unit in the building become shareholders in the holding company, with an exclusive leasehold on their particular unit.</p>
        <p>Other significant adantages of co-op housing includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper, per square foot than condos in the same area, with the added benefit of lower closing costs.</li>
                <li>A future sale of a unit can result in significant financial gains, even though owners aren’t building equity. This is especially true for a long-term investment in a high-cost housing market.</li>
                <li>Co-ops often provide more social “connectivity” than large condo buildings, which can be helpful in big cities, where it’s harder to get to know your neighbors. </li>
            </ul>
