    <h2>WHAT IS A CO-OP?</h2>
      <p>A Co-op or a housing cooperative, is a legal entity, usually a cooperative or a corporation, which owns real estate, consisting of one or more residential buildings.
        It is one type of housing tenure. Housing cooperatives are a distinctive form of home ownership that has many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as single family home ownership, condominiums and renting.The corporation is membership-based, with membership granted by way of a share purchase in the cooperative. Each shareholder in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. </p>
      <p>There are two categories of Co-operative housing; Equity co-operatives and Non-equity co-operatives.
        In equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperative's rules, while in non-equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement, which is similar to a lease.</p>

      <h2>WHY A COOP?</h2>
      
        <p>A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members' resources so that their buying power is leveraged, thus lowering the cost per member in all the services and products associated with home ownership.
        As an advantage also, co-ops offer a less expensive housing option. They are usually cheaper, per square foot than condos in the same area, with the added benefit of lower closing costs. A future sale of a unit can result in significant financial gains, even though owners aren’t building equity.
        Also, a co-op is a multi-unit property owned by a company, usually a Limited-Liability Company (LLC), and people who purchase a unit in the building become shareholders in the holding company, with an exclusive leasehold on their particular unit.</p>
        <p>Other significant adantages of co-op housing includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper, per square foot than condos in the same area, with the added benefit of lower closing costs.</li>
                <li>A future sale of a unit can result in significant financial gains, even though owners aren’t building equity. This is especially true for a long-term investment in a high-cost housing market.</li>
                <li>Co-ops often provide more social “connectivity” than large condo buildings, which can be helpful in big cities, where it’s harder to get to know your neighbors. </li>
            </ul>
