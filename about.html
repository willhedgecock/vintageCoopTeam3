  <div class="col">  
    <div class="col-sm-6">

        <h4>Q. Why were Cooperative housing created?.</h4>
            <p>A. Cooperatives were formed to meet the specific objectives of members and are subject to adapt to members changing needs. A housing cooperative is joint ownership in the homes, clubhouse and grounds in which all the members own a share collectively. Owned and governed by the members, the cooperative gives a unique opportunity to have a voice in the daily operations. In a maintenance-free, active lifestyle community, one is able to make time for the things that matter most.
            </p>

        <h4>Q. How does a housing Cooperative work?</h4>
          <p>A. Membership in a housing cooperative begins with a one-time payment that purchases a share in the cooperative. The cooperative holds the title to the entire property including the dwelling units, land, and common areas and assumes the mortgage, tax and other obligations necessary to finance and operate the facility. Members commit to a monthly charge to cover all expenses related to the operations of the cooperative.
          </p>

        <h4>Q. Who decides the monthly payment dues?.</h4>
            <p>A. The amount is decided on a democratic basis, governed by a Board of Directors comprised of and elected by members in the cooperative.
            This member Board has the fiduciary and operational responsibility to carry out all the functions of the cooperative, including setting the amount of the monthly payments.
            </p>

        <h4>Q. Will the value of my home appreciate?</h4>
            <p>A. SCHEDULED APPRECIATION:
            Vintage Cooperatives will use a scheduled appreciation, limiting appreciation of the share value, compounded annually. This practice is widely used by cooperatives to keep the units affordable overtime, therefore building lengthy waiting lists of prospective buyers and to promote ease of re-sale. The cooperative has the option to change the scheduled appreciation if they so choose.
            </p>

        <h4>Q. Can I customize my home?</h4>
            <p>A. Vintage Cooperatives offers a variety of standard and upgrade design options. Representatives of Vintage Cooperatives will work closely with members through the selection process and any special requests. Personal design selections for standard and upgrade options are available to buyers who purchase during the development phase and prior to construction deadlines..
            </p>

        <h4>Q. Are there ways to title my Cooperative share?</h4>
            <p>A. TITLING MEMBERSHIP:
            The cooperative will provide a way for its members to title their membership share to meet their estate planning needs. Single owner, joint tenants, trusts, transfer on death or a life estate are typical forms of holding title. Proceeds of sale would go to the member’s estate or heir(s), as indicated in their estate planning documents.</p>

            <p>ELIGIBILITY:
            Vintage Cooperatives is an age-restricted community. All owners must qualify for membership by meeting the minimum age and income requirements..
            </p>

            <p>PERSONAL DESIGN CHOICES:
            Vintage Cooperatives offers a variety of standard and upgrade design options.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Q. How is a Co-op structured financially?</h4>
          <p>A. MASTER MORTGAGE LOAN:
          To reduce costs, Vintage Cooperatives will use a federally insured master loan to finance the project, which assures a fixed low interest rate. The cooperative holds title to the property assuming mortgage and tax obligations, relieving members of direct liability; they simply agree to pay their monthly fee, which includes an allocated portion of the master loan, interest and taxes. Members retain tax deductions for mortgage interest, as well as real-estate taxes. Because of their not-for-profit nature, membership involvement, and shared services, cooperatives typically cost less to operate and experience the lowest default rate of any housing alternative.</p>

          <p>SHARE PRICE:
          This represents the difference between the total share value and the prorated portion of the cooperatives first mortgage loan. The share price is a percentage of the share value, which is repaid to the shareowner with appreciation on re-sale.</p>

          <p>MONTHLY PAYMENT:
          The monthly payment includes a proportionate share of the cooperatives master loan, real estate taxes, insurance, reserves, maintenance, professional management services and some utilities. A cost breakdown will be provided to each member before finalizing their purchase.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Q. How do I finance the purchase of my cooperative share?</h4>
          <p>A. INITIAL SHARE COSTS:
          Since the initial share costs are low, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of your home is used to purchase a share in the cooperative, leaving the remainder of your equity to invest, save, or spend on personal enjoyments. The interest from investing equity can be used to pay a portion of the monthly fee, therefore reducing monthly living costs..</p>

          <p>DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
          During the development phase, buyers of a cooperative either use available funds or take out a short-term home equity loan to pay for their membership share until they have sold their current home. The interest on the home equity loan is tax deductible.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Q. How is maintenance handled?</h4>
          <p>A. Members with a maintenance need will call the office or the facility manager. If needed, an outside vendor is called to do the necessary repair work at the owners’ convenience. The invoice for the repair will come to the office. No hassles!
          </p>
      </div> 

      <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h4>Q. What does the monthly pay go towards?.</h4>
            <p>A. The monthly payment is used for the mortgage payment, real estate taxes, operating expenses, maintenance, heat, garbage cable and many other facilities to make living comfortable for members.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Q. What are the resell procedures for a cooperative share?</h4>
          <p>A. RIGHT-TO-SELL
          Re-sale process in a cooperative is handled internally by the on-site property management team to support you in your next move. To implement the Limited Equity Formula, the cooperative holds the first right-to-sell. The re-sale price of the membership share will equal the member’s original investment plus the amount appreciated under the Limited Equity formula. The cooperative has 60-90 days to market the cooperative share and transfer the sale. If the cooperative does not elect to transfer the share, the member may choose to continue to contract with the cooperative or may sell it on the open market to anyone who qualifies for membership. Re-sale of a cooperative share avoids the fees, title and recording costs associated with a typical real-estate transaction.

        <h2>SECURED AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Fosters Cultural Diversity: </h4>
          <p>Many coop members indicate that the possibility for interaction with people from different backgrounds, cultures and income levels is a positive factor in their decision to become a member.</p>
          <h4>Owners and member residents participate at various levels in the decision making process.</h4> 
          <p>Members own the cooperative together and have the security of being able to remain in their homes for as long as they wish, as long as they meet their monthly obligations, and abide by the coop Bylaws, rules, and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Availability of onsite security and property managers to assist residents in their day-to-day activities.
          </p>
          <h4>Affordability: </h4>
          <p>Co-ops have Lower down payment, much lower closing coasts, economies of scale, longer mortgage term. All these make coops more affordable than other ownership housing. Members have no reason to substantially increase monthly charges, unless taxes or operating costs go up, so monthly charges remain reasonable.
          </p>
      </div> 

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Elimination of Outside Landlord: </h4> 
          <p>Coops offer control of one’s living environment and a security of tenure not available in rental housing.
          </p>
          <h4>Strong Consumer power: </h4>
           <p>Through their cooperative association, members can jointly exert influence in order to change tax rates and utility prices and obtain improved services from local governments. The coop, as consumer advocate, can also join with other organizations.
          </p>
          <h4>Members have no personal liability on the coop mortgage.</h4> 
            <p> The cooperative association is responsible for paying off any mortgage loans. This can often make it possible for persons whose income might not qualify them for an individual mortgage to buy a membership in a limited equity coop.
          </p>
          <h4>Co-op members vigorously protect their association’s property.</h4>
           <p>An important benefit of converting rental properties to coop ownership is reduction in vandalism, abuse of property and improved & shared security arrangements. Cooperative presence in a neighborhood reduces neighborhood crime rate.

          <p>A. INITIAL SHARE COSTS:
          Since the initial share costs are low, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of your home is used to purchase a share in the cooperative, leaving the remainder of your equity to invest, save, or spend on personal enjoyments. The interest from investing equity can be used to pay a portion of the monthly fee, therefore reducing monthly living costs..</p>

          <p>DEVELOPMENT PHASE:
          During the development phase, buyers of a cooperative either use available funds or take out a short-term home equity loan to pay for their membership share until they have sold their current home. The interest on the home equity loan is tax deductible.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Q. How is maintenance handled?</h4>
          <p>A. Members with a maintenance need will call the office or the facility manager. If needed, an outside vendor is called to do the necessary repair work at the owners’ convenience. The invoice for the repair will come to the office. No hassles!

      <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h4>Q. What does the monthly pay go towards?.</h4>
            <p>A. The monthly payment is used for the mortgage payment, real estate taxes, operating expenses, maintenance, heat, garbage cable and many other facilities to make living comfortable for members.

        <h4>Q. What are the resell procedures for a cooperative share?</h4>
          <p>A. RIGHT-TO-SELL
          Re-sale process in a cooperative is handled internally by the on-site property management team to support you in your next move. To implement the Limited Equity Formula, the cooperative holds the first right-to-sell. The re-sale price of the membership share will equal the member’s original investment plus the amount appreciated under the Limited Equity formula. The cooperative has 60-90 days to market the cooperative share and transfer the sale. If the cooperative does not elect to transfer the share, the member may choose to continue to contract with the cooperative or may sell it on the open market to anyone who qualifies for membership. Re-sale of a cooperative share avoids the fees, title and recording costs associated with a typical real-estate transaction.

        <h2>SECURED AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Fosters Cultural Diversity: </h4>
          <p>Many coop members indicate that the possibility for interaction with people from different backgrounds, cultures and income levels is a positive factor in their decision to become a member.</p>
          <h4>Owners and member residents participate at various levels in the decision making process.</h4> 
          <p>Members own the cooperative together and have the security of being able to remain in their homes for as long as they wish, as long as they meet their monthly obligations, and abide by the coop Bylaws, rules, and regulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Availability of onsite security and property managers to assist residents in their day-to-day activities.
          </p>
          <h4>Affordability: </h4>
          <p>Co-ops have Lower down payment, much lower closing coasts, economies of scale, longer mortgage term. All these make coops more affordable than other ownership housing. Members have no reason to substantially increase monthly charges, unless taxes or operating costs go up, so monthly charges remain reasonable.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h4>Elimination of Outside Landlord: </h4> 
          <p>Coops offer control of one’s living environment and a security of tenure not available in rental housing.
          </p>
          <h4>Strong Consumer power: </h4>
           <p>Through their cooperative association, members can jointly exert influence in order to change tax rates and utility prices and obtain improved services from local governments. The coop, as consumer advocate, can also join with other organizations.
          </p>
          <h4>Members have no personal liability on the coop mortgage.</h4> 
            <p> The cooperative association is responsible for paying off any mortgage loans. This can often make it possible for persons whose income might not qualify them for an individual mortgage to buy a membership in a limited equity coop.
          </p>
          <h4>Co-op members vigorously protect their association’s property.</h4>
           <p>An important benefit of converting rental properties to coop ownership is reduction in vandalism, abuse of property and improved & shared security arrangements. Cooperative presence in a neighborhood reduces neighborhood crime rate.
